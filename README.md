📌 About BudgetiFy

BudgetiFy is an AI-powered budgeting assistant designed especially for students.
Most expense trackers simply record what you spend. BudgetiFy goes a step further — it analyzes your spending behavior, predicts financial outcomes, and helps you build better money habits.
It’s not just about tracking expenses.
It’s about building financial discipline early in life.

❗ The Problem

Students often struggle with money management because:
Small daily expenses add up unnoticed
There is no structured budgeting discipline

Traditional apps only show reports — they don’t guide decisions

Financial awareness develops too late
Students don’t fail financially due to one big purchase — but because of repeated small, untracked spending.


💡 The Solution
BudgetiFy helps students take control of their finances by:

Tracking expenses in real time

Analyzing spending patterns

Predicting end-of-month outcomes

Simulating future purchase decisions

Encouraging discipline through smart scoring
